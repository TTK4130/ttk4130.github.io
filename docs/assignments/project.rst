====================================
Project description and requirements
====================================

The aim of the project is to develop independence and provide a space where you can creatively engage with the course curriculum.
We also want to support your ability to assess your own work.
In order to do so, we invite you to find a system that may interest you and use the tools of the course to analyze that system.
Some formal requirements follow below, but they are hopefully open-ended enough to allow you to come up with something you are passionate about,
or personally motivated to study.
It can be any system you would like, and if you are unsure whether what you have in mind is a good fit, please ask us and we can talk about it.
Also, you're very welcome to discuss potential projects with each other.
The point is for you to be curious, inquisitive, creative and independent.

Requirements:

* The chosen system must be a rigid system with kinematics.
* The chosen system must have a physically meaningful and realizable control variable.
* Simulation of the system must be done using a bespoke implementation of a numerical solver.
* The choice of numerical solver must be justified.
* You should discuss what new insights the simulation yields for the real system.
* The chosen system must be visualized or animated in 3D.
* Validation of the modelling and simualtion of the system must be possible, either quantitatively or qualitatively.

In the end, the description of the system, the derivation of the model, the various experiments you've elected to run and their results and discussion
should be handed in as a written report, either as a jupyter notebook or in another sufficient format.
Again, the project is intended to be open-ended, so if you have any questions regarding the report or anything else, please ask us and we can talk about it.
