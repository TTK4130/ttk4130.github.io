Problem 1 - Rotation transformations in 2D
==========================================

In this problem, we will study coordinate transformation in the two reference frames shown (in terms of their unit vectors) in the figure below.

.. figure:: figures/ned_and_ship_frames.svg
   :scale: 60%
   :align: center

   The orientation of the unit vectors of the NED-frame and the :math:`s`-frame.

.. admonition:: Tasks

    a) Express the unit vectors :math:`\mathbf{i_s}` and :math:`\mathbf{j_s}` of the :math:`s`-frame in terms of the unit vectors :math:`\mathbf{i_N}` and :math:`\mathbf{j_N}` of the NED-frame. Refer to the figure above for support.

    b) Consider a vector

       .. math::

          \mathbf{v} = \xi_1 \mathbf{i_s} + \xi_2 \mathbf{j_s}

       This vector can also be expressed through the unit vectors of the NED-frame as :math:`\mathbf{v} = \chi_1 \mathbf{i_N} + \chi_2 \mathbf{j_N}`. Your task is to express :math:`\chi_1` and :math:`\chi_2` as functions of :math:`\xi_1`, :math:`\xi_2`, and :math:`\psi`.

    c) A more compact and practical way of transforming the coordinates of vectors between the component directions of the two reference frames (NED-frame and :math:`s`-frame) is to use coordinate vector notation and rotation matrices. Based on the results from the previous task, find the 2Ã—2 matrix :math:`\mathbf{R}^N_s(\psi)` that is defined such that

       .. math::

          \mathbf{v}^N =
          \begin{bmatrix} \chi_1 \\ \chi_2 \end{bmatrix}
          = \mathbf{R}^N_s(\psi)
          \begin{bmatrix} \xi_1 \\ \xi_2 \end{bmatrix}
          = \mathbf{R}^N_s(\psi) \mathbf{v}^s

Problem 2 - Barge with crane
=============================

:numref:`fig:lekter` shows a barge located some distance from a stationary platform. The stationary platform has a fixed reference frame attached to it, referred to as the NED-frame (for North, East, Down), whose axes are pointing northwards, eastwards, and downwards toward the center of the Earth.

.. _fig:lekter:

.. figure:: figures/lekter.pdf
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   A barge with a crane.

We also attach a reference system :math:`x_s, y_s, z_s` (i.e., the :math:`s`-frame) to the barge, as shown in the figure. The z-axis is pointing downwards in accordance with the right-hand rule. The location of the origin of the :math:`s`-frame relative to the origin of the NED-frame is given as:

.. math::

    \mathbf{r}_{s/n} = n \mathbf{i}_{n} + e \mathbf{j}_{n} + d \mathbf{k}_{n}

The position of the crane on the barge is given as:

.. math::

    \mathbf{r}_{c/s} = a \mathbf{i}_{s} + b \mathbf{j}_{s} + c \mathbf{k}_{s}

The angle between the :math:`x_s`-axis and the :math:`x_c`-axis is :math:`\alpha`.

Finally, the distance from the origin of the crane-fixed reference frame to the tip of the crane is :math:`l`.

.. note::

   When we ask for a vector in this problem, your answer should be in the form:

   .. math::

      \mathbf{r} = g \mathbf{i}_{k} + h \mathbf{j}_{k}

   or:

   .. math::

      \mathbf{r}^k =  \begin{bmatrix} g \\ h \end{bmatrix}

   where we need expressions for :math:`g` and :math:`h`.

   **The expressions should be formulated in terms of the parameters** :math:`(a, b, c, l)` **, the variables** :math:`(\psi, \alpha, n, e, d)` **and their time derivatives** :math:`(\dot{\psi}, \dot{\alpha}, \dot{n}, \dot{e}, \dot{d})`.


.. admonition:: Tasks

    a) Find an expression for the position of the origin of the barge-fixed reference frame relative to the origin of the NED-frame expressed in terms of the barge-fixed reference frame.

    b) Find an expression for the position of the tip of the crane relative to the origin of the :math:`s`-frame as a function of :math:`\alpha`. Express the vector in terms of the :math:`s`-frame.

    c) Find an expression for the position of the tip of the crane relative to the origin of the NED-frame. Express the vector in terms of the NED-frame.

    d) What is the angular velocity of the crane when the barge has a turn rate of :math:`\dot{\psi}` and the crane base is rotating at the rate :math:`\dot{\alpha}`?

    e) The vessel has a forward velocity :math:`u` and a sideways velocity of :math:`v` relative to the inertial reference frame (the NED-frame). Find expressions for :math:`\dot{n}` and :math:`\dot{e}` (i.e., the time derivatives of the components in the equation above).

    f) What is the linear velocity of the crane tip? The vessel still moves with a forward velocity component :math:`u` and a sideways velocity component :math:`v`, and in addition, it has an angular speed of magnitude :math:`\dot{\psi}`. The crane has an angular speed with magnitude :math:`\dot{\alpha}`. You can express the answer in terms of the NED-frame.
