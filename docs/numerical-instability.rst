Numerical Instability (WIP)
===========================

When solving differential equations we have to be careful with which solver we use.

Talk about how we define the error of a RK method etc...


Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator
====================================

By comparing the analytical solution to the ODE of the harmonic oscillator, we can visualize the integration error
