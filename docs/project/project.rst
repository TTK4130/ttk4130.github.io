====================================
Simulation Project
====================================

In this project we invite you to find a system of your interest and use the tools provided in this course to analyse it.
The aim of the project is to develop independence and provide a space where you can creatively engage with the course curriculum.
This may suit those who find normal assignments tedious and unengaging, and who would like to deepen their knowledge through independent
application of the course material. The system must fulfil some formal requirements, but these are formulated open-enede enough to allow
you to pick a system which you are passionate about. If you're not sure whether your system is suitable or fulfils the requirements, please
ask us and we'll provide an anwer. Additionally, we encourage to discuss potential projects with each other, as this might spark new ideas.
The point is for you to be curious, inquisitive, creative and independent.

**TL;DR**: Deepen your knowledge by modelling and analysing a system which you find interesting, and most of all exciting.

For your convenience, we have provided you with an example project which details the process from picking a system all the way to delivering your final report.
Please see :ref:`Example Project: Bicycle`.

Other example projects:

- Car drivetrain
- 4-axis robot arm
- Unicycle
- Multistage rocket
- `Parallel Axis Tripteron <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EtXycVGJg4>`_
- `Reaction wheel controlled drone <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kfBEaTncjI>`_

Requirements
=============

* The chosen system must be a rigid system with `kinematics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics>`_.
* The chosen system must have a physically meaningful and realizable control variable.
* Simulation of the system must be done using a bespoke implementation of a numerical solver.
* The choice of numerical solver must be justified.
* You should discuss what new insights the simulation yields for the real system.
* The chosen system must be visualized or animated in 3D.
* Validation of the modelling and simualtion of the system must be possible, either quantitatively or qualitatively.

In the end, the description of the system, the derivation of the model, the various experiments you've elected to run and their results and discussion
should be handed in as a written report, either as a jupyter notebook or in another sufficient format.
Again, the project is intended to be open-ended, so if you have any questions regarding the report or anything else, please ask us and we can talk about it.
